# Mobile App Data Analysis Project
 A guided project done on Dataquest, mainly analyzed data for Google Play Store and Apple Store by using Python
We're working as data analysts for a company that develops free mobile apps for Android and iOS. Since our apps make money through in-app ads, our revenue depends on how many people use them.

Our goal in this project is to figure out what kinds of apps are most likely to attract a large number of users. By analyzing data from the App Store and Google Play, we can help our developers make informed decisions about which types of apps to create.

As of September 2018, there were around 2 million apps on the App Store and 2.1 million on Google Play, making it essential to choose the right type of app to stand out in the competitive market.

The project was done in February, 2025.
